Run [main.cpp](main.cpp) providing path to the input file
1. For the turing machine interpreter, you can use [turing.in](turing.in)
2. For the specializer test, you can use [mix_easy.in](mix_easy.in)
3. For first Futamura projection use [mix_turing.in](mix_turing.in)
4. For second Futamura projection use [mix_mix.in](mix_mix.in)
5. For compiler test (it uses output of second projection) you can use [compiler.in](compiler.in)

P.S. for each run, you need to adjust `.in` file so that it contains correct filepath
